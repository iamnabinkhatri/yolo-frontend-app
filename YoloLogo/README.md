# Yolo
YOLO (You Only Live Once) is more than a soccer group — it’s a crew of friends, players, and fans united by the love of the beautiful game. Whether we’re playing hard or chilling after a match, we keep the energy high and the spirit alive.
Here’s a clean and engaging README/description page you can use for your GitHub repository for the YOLO Soccer Web Design project:
